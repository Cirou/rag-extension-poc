The new requirement is to allow the input to include decimal values (e.g., 1.5, 2.25), enabling the calculation of both days and hours for the cutoff date.Input Changes:Old Behavior: The method received an integer as the cutoffDays argument.New Behavior: The method will read now the parameter as a String (cutoffDaysStr) representing a number that may include decimals (e.g., "1.5").The method should handle integer inputs (e.g., "1", "2") seamlessly without breaking functionality.Cutoff Calculation:Old Behavior: Only whole days were subtracted from the current date (now), ignoring any time precision.New Behavior:Parse the cutoffDaysStr string input to a double.Calculate the cutoff date by subtracting both whole days and the decimal fraction as hours.If cutoffDaysStr is invalid (e.g., not a number), throw an appropriate exception.Validation:If the parsed double value of cutoffDays is less than or equal to 0, throw an exception (DfMethodArgumentException.invalidArgument()) with a meaningful error message.Formatting:The calculated cutoff date should include both the date and time (e.g., 22/01/2025 22:30:00) in the format dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss.Risk and ImpactPreviously, the method only accepted integer numbers as input. Now, it must support both integer and decimal numbers (e.g., 1, 1.5). If an integer number is passed as input (e.g., "1"), the functionality will remain unchanged and continue to work seamlessly.Activities Functional DescriptionFSFunctional Specification descriptionFS1The system executes the job that uses the AuditArchiveMethod by passing the CUTOFF_DAYS parameter as a number with decimals (e.g., "0.5").Technical DescriptionTSTechnical Specification descriptionTS1Modify the method in AuditArchiveMethod.java to:Replace the int cutoffDays input with String cutoffDaysStr.Parse cutoffDaysStr into a double.Validate the parsed double value.Calculate the cutoff date using both days and hours.Format the resulting date in a format that is valid for the Oracle procedure, that includes also the timeESTIMATIONTask NameEstimation (MD)Analysis/Design0.5Implementation/Development1Test Scripts &amp; Test Executions0.5Build and Deployment0.5UAT support, Deployment Instructions Document0.5Total3Professional FiguresProfileEffortSenior Analyst3Total3
